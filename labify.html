                <p><b>Labify is a concept mobile product designed to improve access to preventive healthcare by enabling users to order and 
                    schedule at-home blood tests.</b><br><br>
                    The product focuses on reducing friction in the blood testing process by allowing users to select tests, schedule home visits, and track results in one seamless experience.</p>

            <h1>Why I started this project?</h1>
            <p>I initiated this project to explore how digital products can improve access to healthcare services,
                 particularly for people with limited time or mobility.<br><br>

                Traditional blood testing processes are often fragmented, time-consuming, and poorly adapted to users’ everyday lives. 
                <b>This project allowed me to define the problem space, validate key user needs, and make product decisions balancing convenience, trust, and medical reliability.</b>

            <h1>Problem Statement and Possible Solution</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="two-columns-wrapper">
            <div class="column">
                <h5>Problem</h5>
                <p>The current process of ordering and conducting blood tests is often inconvenient and time-consuming, 
                    requiring patients to visit clinics or laboratories and endure long wait times. This creates a significant 
                    barrier to healthcare access and monitoring for many individuals. There is a need for a more convenient and 
                    accessible solution that enables patients to order and track blood tests from the comfort of their homes.<br>
                    The main challenge was not only access, but also <b>building trust in a remote medical service</b>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h5>Solution</h5>
                <p>A user-friendly and accessible mobile application that allows patients to easily <b>order and track</b> blood tests from home. 
                    The app features an intuitive interface that guides users through selecting the tests they need, scheduling a specialist 
                    visit for blood collection, and receiving their results.<br>
                    The solution prioritizes clarity, transparency, and guidance at each step to reduce uncertainty and increase user confidence.

            <h1>Research</h1>
            <h3>Research approach</h3>

            <p>To better understand user needs and constraints around home blood testing, I conducted qualitative interviews with 
                9 participants and a quantitative survey with 15 respondents.<br>

                The goal was to identify the main barriers, decision factors, and trust concerns related to ordering medical tests 
                outside of traditional clinics.
            </p>

            <h3>Key insights</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Time, not price, is the main barrier – users are willing to pay more to avoid long waiting times and travel.</li>
                    <li>Trust is a critical adoption factor – users are concerned about professionalism, data privacy, and medical reliability.</li>
                    <li>Most users already avoid public clinics, which indicates readiness for private, at-home solutions.</li>
                    <li>Home testing is perceived as a convenience upgrade, not a replacement for medical quality.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These insights directly informed the scope and priorities of the initial product version.</p>

            <h1>Product implications & decisions</h1>

            <p>Based on the research, I made the following product decisions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prioritized fast and flexible scheduling over advanced personalization features.</li>
                <li>Designed the onboarding to build trust early, focusing on clarity, transparency, and credentials of medical staff.</li>
                <li>Made test history and results access a core feature, not an add-on.</li>
                <li>Limited the initial scope to a small, well-explained set of tests to reduce cognitive load and uncertainty.</li>
                <li>Chose in-app communication as the primary channel, as users strongly preferred app-based interactions over phone calls.</li>
            </ul>
            I intentionally deprioritized advanced personalization and recommendation features to focus on trust, clarity, and core functionality in the first release.

            <h1>User Persona</h1>

            <p>This persona represents the primary user segment identified during research and was used to guide key product decisions.<br>
                Anna represents users who value convenience and time efficiency but require a high level of trust and medical reliability before adopting a home testing service.

                <li>Designed onboarding to <b>explicitly communicate medical credibility and data security.</b></li>
                <li>Ensured <b>test history access is always visible and easy to find.</b></li>
                <li>Avoided complex medical language in favor of <b>clear, reassuring copy.</b></li>
                <li>Designed flows that allow ordering tests for <b>family members</b>, not only for oneself.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Emotional friction (anxiety and uncertainty) is as important as functional friction (time and travel).</li>
                <li>Trust concerns extend beyond test accuracy to the entire service experience.</li>
                <li>Waiting and unpredictability are stronger pain points than price.</li>
                <li>Users actively seek social proof before committing to medical services.</li>
                <li>Clear guidance and reassurance are required throughout the flow.</li>

            <h1>Outcome & learnings</h1>
            <h3>What this project demonstrates</h3>
            <p>This project demonstrates my ability to lead an end-to-end product design process - from problem discovery and user 
                research to defining MVP scope, validating assumptions through usability testing, and iterating toward a scalable solution.</p>
            <h3>Key outcomes</h3>
            <p>As a result of the design and validation process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A clear MVP experience was defined, focused on fast test ordering, minimal friction, and early trust-building.</li>
                <li>Key decision points in test selection and checkout were simplified to reduce cognitive load.</li>
                <li>Trust and medical credibility were reinforced through information hierarchy, content clarity, and visual consistency.</li>
                <li>The product was designed to support ordering tests for both individual users and family members.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What I would do next</h3>
            <p>If I were to continue developing this product, I would explore restructuring the booking flow by allowing users to secure an appointment 
                first and then select tests afterward. This approach could reduce decision pressure, better align with time-constrained users’ mental models, and potentially increase conversion in the early stages of the journey.</p>
