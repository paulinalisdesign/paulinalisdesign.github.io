                <h1>About the project</h1>
                <p><b>LOCKUP</b> is a smart home security management application designed for households using connected alarm and access control systems.
                    The product enables users to <b>monitor, control, and manage their home security in real time</b>, while supporting multiple user roles and permissions across family members.
                    The main challenge was designing an interface that balances <b>high-security requirements, daily usability, and clear system feedback</b> for non-technical users in safety-critical scenarios.</p>

        <div class="two-columns-wrapper">
            <div class="column">
                <h5>Problem statement</h5>
                <p>As more households adopted security systems, many users found themselves overwhelmed by the complexity of the accompanying mobile applications.<br>
                    Instead of feeling safer, users often experienced <b>stress and uncertainty</b> when interacting with their security system - unsure whether 
                    the alarm was armed correctly, afraid of triggering it by mistake, or struggling to understand the current system state.<br>
                    This lack of clarity and confidence reduced everyday engagement with the system and undermined its primary purpose: providing a sense of security.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h5>Solution</h5>
                <p>LOCKUP addresses these challenges by providing a <b>calm, confidence-driven interface</b> for everyday security management.<br>
                    The application prioritizes <b>clarity of system status, intentional actions, and error-preventive interactions</b>, allowing 
                    users to control their security system without fear or hesitation.<br>
                    By simplifying critical flows and reducing cognitive load, LOCKUP helps users feel in control of their home security - even in high-stress or time-sensitive situations.</p>

            <h1>How I approached the problem</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="behance">
            <img src="B_LOCKUP/process.png" class="project-photos">
        </div>

        <div class="project-paragraph">
            <p>While the design process followed a structured framework, it remained highly iterative. Insights gathered in earlier stages 
                continuously informed design decisions, particularly around reducing user anxiety and increasing confidence during critical interactions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-paragraph">
            <h1>Research insights</h1>
            <p>I conducted a survey to better understand users’ attitudes toward home security systems and the applications used to control them. 
                The survey consisted of seven questions and was completed by <b>30 participants</b>.<br>

                Respondents were divided into two groups: those who already use a security system and those who do not. This allowed me to compare real usage experiences with perceived barriers to adoption, and identify key sources of anxiety, low confidence, and usability concerns related to security applications.</p>

        <div class="project-paragraph">
            <h3>Key insights from research</h3>
            <p>Based on the research findings, the following key insights directly informed the design direction of the application:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fear of accidental alarm triggering is a major barrier to everyday usage of security apps.</li>
                <li>Even users who own a security system often experience low confidence when interacting with the application.</li>
                <li>Complexity and lack of clear system feedback increase anxiety rather than perceived safety.</li>
                <li>For non-owners, usability concerns outweigh fear of burglary when considering system installation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-paragraph">
            <h1>User interviews</h1>
            <p>I conducted semi-structured interviews with <b>10 participants</b> who either own a security system or are considering installing one. 
                The goal was to understand how people perceive safety, how they interact with security systems in everyday situations, and what factors 
                influence their trust and confidence when using such applications.</p>
            <h3>Key insights from interviews</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A security system significantly increases users’ sense of safety, especially when combined with <b>real-time notifications and camera access.</b></li>
                <li>For most users, <b>mobile app control is considered essential</b>, not an optional add-on.</li>
                <li>Users feel more confident when the system provides <b>clear feedback and visibility</b> of its current state.</li>
                <li>Potential users who do not yet own a system express concerns about cost and their ability to <b>operate the system independently</b> without making mistakes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-paragraph">
            <h1>Personas</h1>
            <p>Based on the research findings, I created a primary persona representing users who value safety but feel anxious and uncertain when interacting 
                with security systems. This persona helped me focus design decisions on reducing fear, increasing confidence, and supporting everyday use without stress.</p>

        <div class="project-paragraph">
            <h3>Design implications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The system must clearly communicate its current state at all times.</li>
                <li>Critical actions (arming/disarming) should be reversible and explicitly confirmed.</li>
                <li>The interface should minimize reliance on codes and complex settings during everyday use.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-paragraph">
            <h1>Empathy map</h1>
            <p>To better understand emotional barriers and everyday behaviors around home security, I created an empathy map based 
                on survey results and user interviews. The goal was to identify moments of anxiety, hesitation, and avoidance that 
                directly influence how users interact with security systems - especially during critical actions such as arming and disarming.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="behance">

        <div class="project-paragraph">
            <h3>Design implications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Users avoid interacting with security systems when they fear making irreversible mistakes.</li>
                <li>The interface must reduce anxiety by clearly communicating system state and consequences of actions.</li>
                <li>Critical actions should be simple, explicit, and supported by clear feedback and confirmation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-paragraph">
            <h1>User flow</h1>
            <p>Based on research insights around user anxiety and fear of accidental alarm triggering, I created a focused user flow to map 
                critical interactions within the security system. The flow highlights key decision points and moments that require clarity, 
                confidence, and explicit feedback - especially when arming or disarming the system.
            </p>
            <p><b>Primary user goal:</b><br>
                Quickly and confidently arm / disarm the security system without fear of accidental triggering.

        <div class="project-paragraph">
            <p>This flow focuses on everyday system control and configuration, rather than full system setup or onboarding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-paragraph">
            <h1>High fidelity wireframes</h1>
            <p>After completing the user flow, my next step was to create wireframes. Wireframes provide a visual representation of the application’s structure and layout, focusing on the arrangement of elements, content placement, and overall navigation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="behance">

        <div class="project-paragraph">
            <h1>Colors & typography</h1>
            <p>The color palette was intentionally limited to green and neutral grey tones to support clarity and reduce cognitive load in a 
                security-critical context.<br>
                Green is used primarily to communicate system safety and positive states (e.g. armed, secure, successful actions), while 
                red is reserved exclusively for critical warnings and errors. Neutral greys provide visual hierarchy without competing for 
                attention, allowing users to quickly scan system status and focus on key actions.<br>
                Roboto was chosen for its high legibility across different screen sizes and lighting conditions, supporting fast information 
                processing during everyday and high-stress situations.

            <h1>High fidelity prototype</h1>
            <p>Prototyping enables me to validate the user flow, interaction patterns, and overall usability of the application before moving to the development phase. By creating interactive prototypes, I can gather valuable feedback from users, stakeholders, and team members, ensuring the design aligns with their expectations and needs.</p>
